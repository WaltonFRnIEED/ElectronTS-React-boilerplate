## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

ElectronJS is a  JS Framework based on NodeJS & Chromium Engine to develop desktop app. It uses Chromium engine for rendering views and NodeJS for file handling and other OS activities. It uses IPC Event bus as a bridge to communicate between two separate environment.

We can use vanilla HTML CSS & JS to work as entry point of views and use them inside electron project. But as the project grows it becomes hard to maintain.

## âš¡ A Better approach

- Instead of vanilla HTML, CSS & JS we will use ReactJS for rendering views
    - We will use vite as frontend build tool
- Instead of JS we will use TS.
    - Vite will help to transpile TS files related to views (React) while bundling.
    - But we canâ€™t do that for ElectronJS codes. Because we have to organize this TS file with separate arrangement.
